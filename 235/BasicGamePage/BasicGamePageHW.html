    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>It is a time of unrest in 1920s Europa. The ashes from the first great war still darken the snow. <br> The capitalistic city-state known simply as “The Factory”, which fueled the war with heavily armored mechs, has closed its doors, drawing the attention of several nearby countries.

        Scythe is an engine-building game set in an alternate-history 1920s period.<br> It is a time of farming and war, broken hearts and rusted gears, innovation and valor. In Scythe, each player represents a character from one of five factions of Eastern Europe who are attempting to earn their fortune and claim their faction's stake in the land around the mysterious Factory. <br> Players conquer territory, enlist new recruits, reap resources, gain villagers, build structures, and activate monstrous mechs.</p>
