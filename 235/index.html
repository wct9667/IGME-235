<p class = "middle" id = "mainInfo">Hi, My name is William Tallarico and I am a 2nd year Game Design and Development student at Rochester Institute of Technology.
I hope to further develop my skills in web-based design. When I graduate from RIT, I hope to have a wide range of skills in the game development field, which will lead to a job in game development. My interests range from shooter video games, to tabletop board games, and anywhere in between.
</p>
