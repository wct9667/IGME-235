        <p>The purpose of the final page will be a portfolio. This means that it will include projects, contact information and a resume. My design will be tailored to employers
        who will be looking at my portfolio. Due to this my design will be more simplistic, trying to lead the audience right to the essential contact. I wlill start with my intro, then go right into projects
    THe contact information and the resume must also be easily accessible.</p>
