        <img id = "portrait" src="images/portrait.png" alt="Self-Portrait">
        <p>I am currently a second year student within the Game Design and Development major at Rochester Insitute of Technology.
            I have significant skills programming within C#, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I also have skills within other tools, such as Unity, and Maya.
            Outside of classes, I partake in Jazz Ensemble as a trumpet player, and I play in RIT's flag football club.</p>

        <h2>Infinite Shooter</h2>
        </div>
        <p>This game was another school project. Within this project I worked alone witin Unity, using C# to program the game logic.
            It has a very similar style to my bullet-hell game, but I built in many new systems that made my work more efficent. I added 
            pools of enemies and bullets, which made the game much more efficient. I also experimented with random spawning and respawning of enemies.
            As well as implenting animations for collisions. <a href = "https://igme-202-2221.github.io/project-1-wct9667/builds/Build%204/" target="_blank">Live Build</a>

                <p>
                    Test of Wills was a class group project that I worked on in a team of 4.
                    Within this game the player must survive against different bosses in
                    a bullet-hell like environment. The game was programmed in C#, using 
                    Monogame as the engine. I personally organized and led the group, designing the architecture of the game.
                    I also did a majority of the programming, including game states, data loading and saving, and overall gameplay
                    logic.
